This is from an email sent to the class on December 17th:

As a starting point, I will suggest that you take a look at these articles:

<https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/>
<https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/code/practice_test_driven_development/>
<https://developer.ibm.com/articles/5-steps-of-test-driven-development/>

<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/quick-start-test-driven-development-with-test-explorer?view=vs-2022> (this is a little less applicable to the stuff from 5010, but I thought it would be a good inclusion to show a different IDE approach)

Also, consider looking at this book, available through Northeastern's library as an e-book for free:

<https://onesearch.library.northeastern.edu/permalink/01NEU_INST/i2gqis/alma9951629600101401>

There are also several other books available through the library for TDD in other languages. The python one, while a bit dated, is still quite good.

Finally, complete this IBM created course on TDD. You'll need to sign up for an IBM cloud account, and while it asks you for credit card information as part of the registration process, I've found that you can skip that step and the log in to the course page to access the materials. You can find the course at this link:
