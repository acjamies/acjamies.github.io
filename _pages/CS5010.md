with some additional information as needed to support the course.

# Labs

[Iterator Pattern Lab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lOzBfP4KwTYgiKNLdoCHAlxuonIRG8TtamK_kdTEzus/edit?usp=sharing) [[Data](https://acjamies.github.io/Titanic.csv)]

[MVC Pattern Lab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TJHNO3Z4vsCW-EWHtKHlezHMHhy8Az709mYgRRO-TD4/edit?usp=sharing)

[Visitor Pattern Lab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16xhgs6thoLs7E4Sr4KhaYMFMTsNYZWjhFT35AOIADek/edit?usp=sharing)

[Decorator Lab + Solution](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~mmh/APD/observers/) Here's a really nice assignment+solution that incorporates the decorator pattern and the observable pattern. I thought about creating a new lab/solution based around this, but thought that this page did a much better job of putting it all together, even if it is a bit older. Verified that solutions work under current JDK, but some of the observable elements are now being deprecated.

# TDD Resources
This is from an email sent to the class on December 17th:

As a starting point, I will suggest that you take a look at these articles:

<https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/>
<https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/code/practice_test_driven_development/>
<https://developer.ibm.com/articles/5-steps-of-test-driven-development/>

<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/quick-start-test-driven-development-with-test-explorer?view=vs-2022> (this is a little less applicable to the stuff from 5010, but I thought it would be a good inclusion to show a different IDE approach)

Also, consider looking at this book, available through Northeastern's library as an e-book for free:

<https://onesearch.library.northeastern.edu/permalink/01NEU_INST/i2gqis/alma9951629600101401>

There are also several other books available through the library for TDD in other languages. The python one, while a bit dated, is still quite good.

Finally, complete this IBM created course on TDD. You'll need to sign up for an IBM cloud account, and while it asks you for credit card information as part of the registration process, I've found that you can skip that step and the log in to the course page to access the materials. You can find the course at this link:
